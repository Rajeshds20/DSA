'''
Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.
'''

You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input parameters and returns the value of the missing number.
